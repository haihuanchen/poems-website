<h1>Choose</h1>
<h3>BY Kevyn Aucoin</h3>

Today I choose life. <br/>
Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... <br/>
To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices.<br/>
Today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.<br/>
