<h1>The Art of Listening</h1>
<h3>BY Eckhart Tolle</h3>

  When listening to another person, <br/>
  don't just listen with your mind, <br/>
  listen with your whole body. <br/>
  Feel the energy field of your inner body as you listen. <br/>
  That takes attention away from thinking <br/>
  and creates a still space which enables you to truly listen without the mind interfering.<br/>
  You are giving the other person space to be. <br/>
  It is the most precious gift you can give.<br/>
  Most people don't know how to listen because the major part of their attention is taken up by thinking.<br/>
  They pay more attention to thinking than to what the other person is saying,<br/>
  and none at all to what really matters:<br/>
  the Being of the other person underneath the words and the mind.<br/>
  Of course, you cannot feel someone else's Being except through your own.<br/>
  This is the beginning of the realization of oneness,<br/>
  which is love.<br/>
  At the deepest level of Being,<br/>
  you are one with all that is.<br/>
  Just like what God said to Moses:<br/>
  I am that I am.<br/>
