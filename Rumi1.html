<h1>Out Beyond Ideas</h1>
<h3>BY Rumi</h3>

Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,<br/>
there is a field. <br/>
I’ll meet you there.<br/>
  
When the soul lies down in that grass,<br/>
the world is too full to talk about.<br/>
  
Ideas, language, even the phrase ‘each other’,<br/>
doesn’t make any sense.<br/>
  
what you seek is seeking you. <br/>
