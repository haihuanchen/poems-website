<h1>Strength of the Mountain</h1>
<h3>BY Unknown</h3>

The mountains in the heart of your soul<br/>
stand effortlessly through time.<br/>
Stationary are the fine peaks<br/>
of your noble grace.<br/><br/>
  
The soul of time - strong.<br/>
fortified by experience and the weathering<br/>
of all that has stood in its way.<br/><br/>
  
May you find the strength of the mountain<br/>
in the heart of your soul.<br/>
For it is there - <br/>
unmoving, unlimited<br/>
and with the face of time<br/>
etched in its memory. <br/>
