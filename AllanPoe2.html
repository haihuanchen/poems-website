<h1>Alone</h1>
<h3>BY Edgar Allan Poe</h3>

From childhood’s hour I have not been<br/>
As others were—I have not seen<br/>
As others saw—I could not bring<br/>
My passions from a common spring—<br/>
From the same source I have not taken<br/>
My sorrow—I could not awaken<br/>
My heart to joy at the same tone—<br/>
And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—<br/>
Then—in my childhood—in the dawn<br/>
Of a most stormy life—was drawn<br/>
From ev’ry depth of good and ill<br/>
The mystery which binds me still—<br/>
From the torrent, or the fountain—<br/>
From the red cliff of the mountain—<br/>
From the sun that ’round me roll’d<br/>
In its autumn tint of gold—<br/>
From the lightning in the sky<br/>
As it pass’d me flying by—<br/>
From the thunder, and the storm—<br/>
And the cloud that took the form<br/>
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br/>
Of a demon in my view—<br/>
