<h1>Oneness</h1>
<h3>BY Conversations with God</h3>

What you do to others, you do to yourself; <br/>
what you fail to do for others, you fail to do for yourself;<br/>
the pain of others is your pain;<br/>
the joy of others is your joy.<br/>
When you disclaim any part of it,<br/>
you disclaim a part of your self.<br/>
