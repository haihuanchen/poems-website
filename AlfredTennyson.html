<h1>The Kraken</h1>
<h3>BY Alfred Lord Tennyson</h3>

Below the thunders of the upper deep,<br/>
Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,<br/>
His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep<br/>
The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee<br/>
About his shadowy sides; above him swell<br/>
Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;<br/>
And far away into the sickly light,<br/>
From many a wondrous grot and secret cell<br/>
Unnumbered and enormous polypi<br/>
Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.<br/>
There hath he lain for ages, and will lie<br/>
Battening upon huge sea worms in his sleep,<br/>
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;<br/>
Then once by man and angels to be seen,<br/>
In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.<br/>
