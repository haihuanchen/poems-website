<h1>Annabel Lee</h1>
<h3>BY EDGAR ALLAN POE</h3>

<p>
It was many and many a year ago, </br>
   In a kingdom by the sea, </br>
That a maiden there lived whom you may know </br>
   By the name of Annabel Lee; </br>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought </br>
   Than to love and be loved by me. </br>

I was a child and she was a child, </br>
   In this kingdom by the sea, </br>
But we loved with a love that was more than love— </br>
   I and my Annabel Lee— </br>
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven </br>
   Coveted her and me. </br>

And this was the reason that, long ago, </br>
   In this kingdom by the sea, </br>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling </br>
   My beautiful Annabel Lee; </br>
So that her highborn kinsmen came </br>
   And bore her away from me, </br>
To shut her up in a sepulchre </br>
   In this kingdom by the sea. </br>

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, </br>
   Went envying her and me— </br>
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know, </br>
   In this kingdom by the sea) </br>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night, </br>
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</br>

But our love it was stronger by far than the love </br>
   Of those who were older than we— </br>
   Of many far wiser than we— </br>
And neither the angels in Heaven above </br>
   Nor the demons down under the sea </br>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul </br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </br>

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams </br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </br>
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes </br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </br>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side </br>
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, </br>
   In her sepulchre there by the sea— </br>
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.</br>
