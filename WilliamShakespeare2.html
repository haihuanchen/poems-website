<h1>Sonnet 55</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

Not marble nor the gilded monuments<br/>
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,<br/>
But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br/>
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.<br/>
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br/>
And broils root out the work of masonry,<br/>
Nor Mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burn<br/>
The living record of your memory.<br/>
’Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity<br/>
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room<br/>
Even in the eyes of all posterity<br/>
That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br/>
    So, till the Judgement that yourself arise,<br/>
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.<br/>
