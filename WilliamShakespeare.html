<h1>Sonnet 18</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br/>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br/>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br/>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br/>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br/>
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br/>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br/>
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br/>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br/>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br/>
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br/>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br/>
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br/>
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br/>
