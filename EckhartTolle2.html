<h1>Human Being</h1>
<h3>BY Eckhart Tolle</h3>
  
Human alone is never enough,<br/>
no matter how hard you try, or what you achieve.<br/>
Then there is being,<br/>
it is found in stillness,<br/>
alert presence of the consciousness itself,<br/>
the consciousness you are.<br/>
Human is form, Being is formless.<br/>
Human and Being are not separate but interwoven.<br/>
