<h1>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud </h1>
<h3>BY William Wordsworth</h3>

I wandered lonely as a cloud <br/>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills, <br/>
When all at once I saw a crowd, <br/>
A host, of golden daffodils; <br/>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br/>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. <br/><br/>

Continuous as the stars that shine <br/>
And twinkle on the milky way, <br/>
They stretched in never-ending line <br/>
Along the margin of a bay: <br/>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance, <br/>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. <br/><br/>

The waves beside them danced; but they <br/>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: <br/>
A poet could not but be gay, <br/>
In such a jocund company: <br/>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought <br/>
What wealth the show to me had brought: <br/><br/>

For oft, when on my couch I lie <br/>
In vacant or in pensive mood, <br/>
They flash upon that inward eye <br/>
Which is the bliss of solitude; <br/>
And then my heart with pleasure fills, <br/>
And dances with the daffodils. <br/><br/>
