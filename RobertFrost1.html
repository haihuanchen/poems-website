<h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
<h3>BY Robert Frost</h3>

Some say the world will end in fire, <br/>
Some say in ice. <br/>
From what I’ve tasted of desire <br/>
I hold with those who favor fire. <br/>
But if it had to perish twice, <br/>
I think I know enough of hate <br/>
To say that for destruction ice <br/>
Is also great <br/>
And would suffice. <br/>
