<h1>Highest Truth, Greatest Love</h1>
<h3>BY Conversations with God</h3>

Be a living, breathing example of the Highest Truth that resides within you. <br/>
Speak humbly of yourself, so someone cannot mistake your Highest Truth for a boast.<br/>
Speak softly, so no one thinks you are merely calling for attention.<br/>
Speak gently, that all might know of Love.<br/>
Speak openly, so no one thinks you have something to hide.<br/>
Speak less often, so that your word may truly be taken seriously.<br/>
Speak respectfully, that no one is dishonored.<br/>
Speak lovingly, that every syllable may heal.<br/>
Speak of God with every utterance.<br/>
Be a gift to everyone who enters your life, and to everyone whose life you enter.<br/>
When someone enters your life unexpectedly, look for the gift that person has come to receive from you.<br/>
Every person come to you has come to receive a gift from you. <br/>
In so doing, he gives a gift to you - the gift of your experiencing and fulfilling Who You Are.<br/>
